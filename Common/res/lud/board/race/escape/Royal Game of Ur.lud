While no rules have been passed down for this game specifically, a rule set based on a successor game, 20 Squares, has been applied to this slightly different board. The board consists of a grid of 3x4 squares, connected to a grid of 3x2 squares by a short bridge of 1x2 squares connecting the central rows of the other two grids. The game was played with four tetrahedral dice and 7 small disks per player as playing pieces.")

If a player lands on an opponent's spot, they are removed from the board and may reenter on a subsequent turn. A rosette in the center of the central track marks the spot where a player is safe from capture. Rosettes in the four corners allow a player to roll again. A player wins when they remove all seven of their pieces from the board by rolling the exact number of spaces left in the track, plus one."))
